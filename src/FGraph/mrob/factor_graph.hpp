/**
 * This class provides the general structure for encoding Factor Graphs and
 * to support the implementation of the inference solution to the joint probability P(x,u,z).
 * The solution to this joint probability is equivalent to a Nonlinear Least Squares (NLSQ) problem.
 *
 * Factor Graphs are bipartite graphs, meaning that we express the relations from a set of vertices "nodes"
 * which include our state variables through a set of vertices "factors", capturing the inherent distribution
 * of the nodes variables due to observations.
 * Bipartite is in the sense that edges of the graph are always from nodes to factors or vice versa.
 *
 * We require two abstract classes,
 *  - Class Node
 *  - Class Factor. here see factor.hpp for the conventions on residuals, observations, etc.
 *
 * XXX, actually key as addresses won't work in python interface. Better use id_t (uint)
 * Both data containers are stored in vectors (XXX prev unordered sets) whose keys are their addresses. By doing this, we can
 * iterate and quickly find elements in both data containers.
 *
 * Each problem instantaition should implement methods for solving the graph and storing the
 * necessary data, such as information matrix, factorizations, etc.
 *
 * TODO for large scale problems, build a subset of the graphs considered, using a tree or other structures
