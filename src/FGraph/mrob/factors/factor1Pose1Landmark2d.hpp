/**
 * The factor1Pose1Landmark2d is a vertex representing the distribution between
 * a 2D pose and a Landmark, a 2D point. The observation consist of Range and Bearing.
 *
 * The observation is a 2D point, in the local frame of the current 2D pose.
 * The two Nodes that the factor is connecting, which are provided by their
 * shared_ptr's, are:
 *  - 1 Pose2d
 *  - 1 Landmark2d
 * We provide the node's Id to get the correspondent Jacobian
 *
 *
 * In particular, the relation between the transformation of poses is:
 *   z = h(x)
 *
 * z = [range,bearing] is a 2d vector, composed of a range and bearing in the local frame.
 * l is a 2d point encoding the landmark position l = [x,y]
 *
 *
 * Constructor functions will be overloaded to include the pointers of the nodes,
 * The convention is 2d pose, we observe node destination,
 * such that: Factor1Pose1Landmark2d(nodePose, nodeLandmark, ...
 *
 * The observations relate a pair of nodes. The order matters, since this will
 * affect the order on the Jacobian block matrix
