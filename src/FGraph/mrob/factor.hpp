/**
 * Factor class is a base pure abstract class defining factors,
 * the second type of vertexes on factor graphs (bipartite).
 * Factors keep track of all their neighbour nodes they are connected to.
 *
 * By convention, the residuals r_i are ALWAYS formulated as follows:
 *
 * -------------------------------------------
 * |           r(x) =  h(x) - z              |
 * -------------------------------------------
 *
 * otherwise the optimization will not work properly.
 *
 * Because the number of Nodes they point to is fixed, we only allow
 * to indicate its node neighbours at the object declaration.
 * On the abstract class constructor they are not indicated, but should
 * be on any child class.
 *
 * Constructor functions will be overloaded to include the pointers of the nodes,
 * The convention is from node 1, to node 2, and etc. such that: myfactor2poses(n1, n2, ...)
 *
 * Conventions (transparent for users, but good to know):
 * - The connecting nodes are stores ordered on a vector. The user does not *have*
 *   to provide such ordering, but at creation each factor such comply this.
 *
 * - Jacobian is a block matrix corresponding to the Jacobian of the first node J1,
 *   then second node J2, etc, such that J = [J1, J2, ..., Jn],
