/**
 * Factor1PoseToPpoint2Point is a vertex in the Fgraph library that models
 * the distribution of observations of a 3D pose. The purpose of this factors is to estimate
 * the relative transformation from two different sets of point clouds, given some planar constraaints.
 *
 * Observations
 *  - Point x
 *  - Point y, from reference y
 *
 * State to estimate is 3D pose y^T_x.
 *
 * The residual, as a convention in the library is:
 *   r = f(x) = (Tx - y) -> 0 if the points are coincident.
 *
 * The Jacobian is then
 *  dr = [-(Tx)^, I]
 *
 * TODO: correctly characterize the covariance, since this is a contribution from 2 rv
